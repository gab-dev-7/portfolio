## Hello World

Welcome to `gawindlin.com`. If you are reading this, you’ve found my corner of the internet.

I built this site to serve as a digital archive—a place to document my work, my studies at ETH Zürich, and the projects that keep me up at night. While the site itself is built with Astro and styled to also function like my beloved Neovim, the content you'll find here going forward will likely dig much deeper than HTML and CSS.

## The "Aha" Moment

For a long time, I built things for the web. I have projects like [Screen Savor](https://github.com/gab-dev-7/screen-savor) in my history, and they taught me a lot. But recently, I realized my interests have shifted.

There was a specific day recently that defined this shift for me. I spent the morning reinstalling Arch Linux and configuring Hyprland (because, of course, kernel panic). I spent the afternoon debugging my Homelab infrastructure because an ad-blocker config took down the internet for the whole house. I ended the day grinding through Data Structures and Algorithms assignments for university.

Exhausted but satisfied, I realized: **This is it.**

I'm not just a developer; I'm a systems enthusiast. I love the grit of low-level programming, the 'logic' of C, and the endless rabbit holes of Linux administration.

## What to Expect Here

This blog won't just be about polished finish lines; it will be about the process. I plan to write about:

- **Infrastructure & Homelab:** Documenting my setups, like the Kubernetes cluster I help manage for [VIS ETHZ](https://vis.ethz.ch) or my personal microservices architecture.
- **Low-Level Learning:** Deep dives into C, POSIX sockets, and things I learned building tools like my [TCP Port Scanner](https://github.com/gab-dev-7/port-scanner).
- **Cybersecurity:** Write-ups on CTFs (Capture The Flags), security tools I'm building (like `sec-suite`), and vulnerabilities I'm studying.
- **Uni Life:** The occasional proof from my studies at ETH that was too interesting (or painful) not to share.

## Let's Connect
